# -----------------------------------------------------

Config.pm
	start with implementation of etc/puma/puma.xml (modify path/file w/ object params)
	do tree walking next

Server.pm
	fake out CGI

Tag.pm

Engine.pm

puma.cgi



Do this last:

Create an object for generic access to stateful data
	- use as both file and orb interface (eventually db?)
	- perhaps an entire class of objects
